Past executives still have read rights (Reader Role) on executive content,
however, their managerial (Manager Role) position will be revoked. This takes
effect when the next year execs are added.

For example (assume current execs are 2012):

    UQMC Executives 2013    Manager Role
    UQMC Executives 2012    Manager Role (Has added next 2013 Execs)
    UQMC Executives 2011    Reader Role
    UQMC Executives 2010    Reader Role

Another Example (assume current execs are 2014):

    UQMC Executives 2015    Manager Role
    UQMC Executives 2014    Manager Role (Has added next 2015 Execs)
    UQMC Executives 2013    Reader Role
    UQMC Executives 2012    Reader Role 
    UQMC Executives 2011    Reader Role
    UQMC Executives 2010    Reader Role
